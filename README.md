Independent Ruby Rails project for week 3 of Rails track at Epicodus. This is a simple, cloned e-commerce site that needed refactoring. The objectives here were to implement AJAX and refactor at least 6 of 12 objectives.

## Specs

1. Using AJAX, allow users to add products to their shopping cart from the index page. Item should be added to shopping cart. Number of items in cart should display in navbar.
2. Using AJAX, allow users to show/hide product detail.
3. Project detail will include an image (Paperclip or link) and description.
4. Allow users to delete items from cart without page reloaded.
5. Delete functionality will remove item from shopping cart and update total price.

## Additional Specs and Refactors

1. Add flash messages for sign up and sign in.
2. Allow admin to update and delete product.
3. Display flash messages when admin updates or deletes a product.
4. Add Paperclip for product image upload.
5. Add product validations.
